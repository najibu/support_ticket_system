# A Support Ticket System

# Summary 
## What will we build?
### Our ticket system is simple:

1. When users visit the contact page, they will be able to submit a ticket to contact us.

2. Once they've created a ticket, the system will send us an email to let us know that there is a new ticket.

3. The ticket system automatically generates a unique link to let us access the ticket.

4. We can view all the tickets.

5. We can be able to reply, edit, change tickets' status or delete them.

## What is covered?
1. How to create databases.

2. Most important Laravel features: migrations. 

3. How to use Request to validate forms.

4. How to install different packages.

5. Laravel's helper functions.

6. Sending emails using Gmail and Sendgrid is easy, right?

7. How to define Eloquent Relationships and work with those relationships easily.
